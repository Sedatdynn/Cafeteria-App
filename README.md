### Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- assets
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure I have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- core/
|- product/
|- views/
|- main.dart
```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```
1- core - Contains the business independent structures of the project.
2- product - Contains the business-dependent structures of the project..
3- views - Contains all the ui of my project, contains sub directory for each screen.. 
4- main.dart - This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file.
```

### Core

This directory contains the business independent structures of the project. A separate file is created for each type as shown in example below:

```
core/
|- constants/
  |- border/
  |- responsive/
|- theme/
  |- color/
```

### Product

Contains the business-dependent structures of the project. A separate file is created for each type as shown in example below:

```
product/
|- constants/
  |- texts/
  |- duration/
  |- warningMessage/  
```

### Views

This directory contains all the ui of my application. Each screen is located in a separate folder making it easy to combine group of files related to that particular screen. A separate file is created for each ui as shown in example below:

```
views/
|- drawer/
|- home/
|- order/
|- payment/  
```
### Home

This directory contains home screen of my application.This file contains Flutter MVVM Architecture to communicate between the UI & business logic so MVVM is providing this in an easy way as you can hold my all business logic inside the ViewModel class and UI separately. Files are as shown in example below:

```
home/
|- cubit/
|- model/
|- service/
|- view/  
```

### Main

This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file.

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:cafeteria_app/core/theme/theme_color_shelf.dart';
import 'package:cafeteria_app/product/constant/product_const_shelf.dart';
import 'package:cafeteria_app/views/home/home_shelf.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  HttpOverrides.global = MyHttpOverrides();
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocProvider(
        create: (context) {
          return HomeCubit(
              GeneralService(ProjectNetworkManager.instance.service, "EL0E"))
            ..fetchAllProduct();
        },
        child: MaterialApp(
          debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
          title: MainTexts.appTitle,
          theme: ThemeData(
            primarySwatch: AppColors.primarySwatch,
          ),
          home: const HomeView(),
        ));
  }
}

class MyHttpOverrides extends HttpOverrides {
  @override
  HttpClient createHttpClient(SecurityContext? context) {
    return super.createHttpClient(context)
      ..badCertificateCallback =
          (X509Certificate cert, String host, int port) => true;
  }
}
